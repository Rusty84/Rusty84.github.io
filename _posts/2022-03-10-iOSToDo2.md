I have completed Phase 2 of my iOS To-Do List application.
<br>
<br>
The application allows new items to be added to a list with a given priority. Items in the list are then sorted and displayed based on the assigned priority. 

In Phase 2, I have added the ability to persist data in the list using Core Data and the ability to dismiss an item from the list once completed. By tapping into the item and tapping the done button.
