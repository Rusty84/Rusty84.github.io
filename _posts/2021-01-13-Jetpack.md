I have been experimenting with Android Jetpack Compose. Android's modern toolkit for creating and building native UI. Currently in Alpha.

Here is my first attempt at a scrollable card list in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose. Making use of Layouts, Lazy Lists and Material UI components.

<video controls="controls" autoplay = "autoplay" loop="loop" width="500" height="512">
  <source src="/assets/media/p2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
