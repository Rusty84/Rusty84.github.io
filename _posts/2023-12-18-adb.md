I haven't blogged lately and wanted to get one finished before the end of the year. So I decided to write a blog post about Android Debug Bridge (ADB) which I learnt more about at droidcon London in October.

Android Debug Bridge is a command-line tool that allows communication between a computer and an Android device. It enables developers and testers to execute various commands on an Android device or emulator from a computer. ADB is essential for tasks such as installing and debugging apps, accessing the device's shell, transferring files between the device and the computer, and more.

Let's look at some simple adb commands you can run in the terminal to get started with your Android device or emulator.
