Reflecting on my album cover flow. I wanted to make the UI a bit more interesting<br>
<br>

I came across <a href="https://proandroiddev.com/mirror-effect-with-jetpack-compose-78db11b5c30b" target="_blank">this</a> article by Pankaj Rai. The article explains how to create a mirror image effect using Jetpack Compose. 
<br>
<br>
Taking inspiration from the article. I have added a mirror effect to my album cover flow. I love the result the mirror effect adds.
