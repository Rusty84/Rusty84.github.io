I have completed Phase 1 of my iOS To-Do List application.
<br>
<br>
The application allows new items to be added to a list with a given priority. Items in the list are then sorted and displayed based on the assigned priority. 

In Phase 2, I will be adding the ability to persist data in the list using Core Data and the ability to dismiss an item from the list once completed with a swipe.
